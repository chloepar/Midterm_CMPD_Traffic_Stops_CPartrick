# Charlotte Mecklenberg Police Department (CMPD) Traffic Stops
My tableau project is about Traffic Stops by the Charlotte Mecklenberg Police Department (CMPD)

## Analysis Guide
### Traffic Stops in Charlotte

The second page of this analysis provides insight into traffic stop data for the Charlotte Mecklenberg Police Department (CMPD). The analysis includes data pertinent to: traffic stops, traffic searches, use of force in these events, and the rate at which contraband was ultimately found (as a result of a traffic search). Any citizen can be stopped, but those who are searched also have to have been stopped. Likewise, use of force can only happen if they have been stopped, and contraband can only be found if they are searched.

### Charlotte's Population

The third page of the analysis dives into the overall population of Charlotte, and looks at the rate of traffic stops and traffic searches based on the entire population. The goal here is to highlight the differences between ethnicities, especially when accounting for the overarching % of population each ethnicity in Charlotte has. This data includes government census information for the past 10 years
